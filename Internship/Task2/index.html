            Dogs, scientifically known as Canis lupus familiaris, are domesticated mammals that have been loyal companions to humans for thousands of years. They are descendants of wolves and are part of the Canidae family, which also includes foxes, coyotes, and jackals. Over time, selective breeding has resulted in a remarkable variety of dog breeds, each with unique physical and behavioral traits.</p>
