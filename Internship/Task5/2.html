    <h2 class="cold">The Coolest Second Page</h2>
    <p>Feeling uncool? That’s the first sign you’re overthinking it. Coolness isn’t about being the loudest in the room or perfectly fitting a mold—it’s about being comfortable in your own skin. The more you stop worrying about being cool, the cooler you become.</p>
    <h3>Act Like You Don't Care</h3>
    <p>Oh, you’re feeling uncool? Whatever. Coolness is overrated anyway. People waste too much time trying to chase it when the real trick is just doing your thing and letting everything else fall into place.You don’t need approval, you don’t need to try, and honestly, it doesn’t even matter. Just exist, do what you enjoy, and let people catch up. If they don’t? Their loss</p>
    <h3>Learn to Laugh....  at Cool</h3>
    <p>Exactly. Cool is just an illusion people stress over to fit in or stand out. The funniest part? The moment you stop caring about being cool is when you actually become it. Real coolness isn’t in the clothes, the trends, or the approval—it’s in the absurdity of it all. Laugh at the idea of "cool." Wear something ridiculous just because you like it. Do something cringe and own it. Trip over your own feet and bow like you meant to do it. Coolness is just confidence wrapped in a joke no one else gets. And when you’re in on the joke? That’s ultimate cool</p>
